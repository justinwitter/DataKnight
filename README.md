Hi! Welcome to DataKnight.

This project aims to help casual chess players improve their game as fast as possible, while also compiling the concepts I've learned from chess over the past year or so. 

In the interest of speed, it would be counterintuitive to analyze hundreds (if not thousands) of openings, structures, and endgames that an advanced player may be exposed to. For the beginner level, this is quite trivial. Instead the main focus is fundamentals. I believe (along with many GMs) that the best way to improve from these levels is to develop sound habits that apply to multiple positions and lead to tactical play. This emphasis on tactics 

The focus is on fundamental chess, not perfect chess.

This project is made for the hardstuck 800 elo player that doesn't understand how they keep hanging their queen every game. Most of the time this comes from a lack of fundamentals.

## Background

I started playing chess in August of 2022 and, after about a year of non-concurrent play, I've been able to increase my ELO rating from 479 to 1222 [link](https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/justinwitter/0). While 1200 is still a "beginner rating" (50th percentile for chess.com) and nothing to be immensely proud of, I've noticed a considerable difference in the learning rate between myself and many fellow peers around this level.

While being stuck around 600 I stumbled upon [chessbrah](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8N8j2e7RpPnpqbISqi1SJ9_wrnNU3rEm), a YouTube channel that posted videos of GMs playing lower rated players and displaying fundamental chess rules instead of crushing. In fact, the GMs lost some games (with X5 proability) just to illustrate the emphasis on sound chess rather than perfect chess. At the end of the day I realized that the changes to my decision-making in chess were now being data-driven, with that data coming from GM teachings. Chess is all about optimal decison-making so I wanted to dive into the landscape of beginner chess to truly see how these games were being played. If I could identify common mistakes and determine better alternatives, on average this information would provide myself and others with the best opportunity to move up the ranks quickly.

This project is targeted towards casual players below 1000 (42% of playerbase) to build habits that will improve their fundamentals and allow them to play a solid game barring positional intricacies and time constraints. This opposes the conventional approach of chess engines which simply identify the best possible move in the position with little insight as to why.

Openings - a very crucial concept as it decides very game
While memorizing 15 moves to set an opening trap may be ideal for some, this approach a. wastes time that could be spent on fundamentals and b. doesn't work on experienced players that have either seen the trap before or play conservative lines. Pick openings with straightforward development and open positions. This allows for easy tactics instead of complicated positional theory.
